## 💼 The Project

Everyone builds portfolios.
**I build working systems.**

This is a **real-world document management platform** designed for **Autoteknic**, a technical services company tired of playing digital hide-and-seek with files.

What did I give them?

* A clean UI.
* A ruthless backend.
* A plug-and-run `.exe` they didn’t have to think twice about.

I didn't pitch slides.
I pitched **results**.

## 🧠 What It Actually Does

| Feature                                          | Why It Exists                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🧑‍💻 **Local Admin Only**                          | Because not everything needs a login page from 2007.           |
| 📁 **Customer + Project + Doc Type Structure**   | Keeps engineers from losing their minds.                       |
| 📥 **Upload Modal + Checklist UI**               | Upload once, see what’s missing, feel in control.              |
| 🔍 **Search by Serial/Project Name**             | Because “Where did we save that?” should never be asked again. |
| 🗂️ **Auto Folder Creation**                      | Just type and it builds the path for you.                      |
| 🔒 **SHA-256 Hashing + MIME Type Detection**     | File integrity and smart type checking — baked in.             |
| 📦 **ZIP Export for Full Projects**              | One-click archive. Email-ready.                                |
| 🌓 **Dark Mode Toggle**                          | Because documentation shouldn't blind you.                     |
| 🔁 **Frontend Swappable Without Breaking Logic** | Change how it looks, not how it works.                         |

## 🎯 Why This Isn’t Just Another “App”

Because I didn’t build this for likes.
I built it for **a real business** with **real problems** and **no time to babysit software**.

📍 **Offline-first**
📍 **Drive-specific**
📍 **Error-proof**
📍 **Client-deployable**
📍 **No framework addiction**

## 🔒 The Code? Not Here.

I don’t leak client IP.
That’s the difference between freelancers and professionals.

## 🥶 Closing Argument

> I don’t overbuild.
> I don’t oversell.
> I **deliver**.

Now go manage some documents.
Or better yet, let me build the system for you.
